# Finetuning-DistillBert
I used the Hugging Face Library to finetune the Distilbert model for Sentiment Analysis.                                                                                   
Here is the [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews) on Kaggle:                                               
Here is the [Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aaaaaadssdasdasd/finetuning-distilbert-on-imdb-dataset?scriptVersionId=134655275) on Kaggle                             
Note: There are some issues with Notebooks on Kaggle with the Hugging face Library with imports. If you make a copy of the notebook above to run my code, you will not have these issues!                                                                                                                                                         
WIP: Evaluation of the model coming soon!
